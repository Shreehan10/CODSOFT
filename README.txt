# SMS Spam Detection - Model Implementation Summary

## Overview
This comprehensive SMS spam detection system implements multiple machine learning classifiers to identify spam messages with high accuracy. The system uses advanced text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to achieve optimal performance.

## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. **Enhanced Text Preprocessing**
- URL removal
- Email address removal  
- Phone number removal
- Special character and digit removal
- Case normalization
- Whitespace cleanup

### 2. **Multiple Feature Extraction Techniques**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** with n-grams (unigrams and bigrams)
- **Count Vectorization** for comparison
- Stop word removal
- Feature dimensionality optimization

### 3. **Multiple Classifier Implementation**
- **Naive Bayes (Multinomial & Gaussian)**
- **Logistic Regression** 
- **Support Vector Machines (Linear & RBF)**
- **Random Forest**

### 4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC metrics
- Confusion matrices for all models
- ROC curve comparisons
- Cross-validation support

### 5. **Advanced Visualizations**
- Model performance comparisons
- Word clouds for spam vs ham analysis
- Feature importance analysis
- Interactive prediction function

## Usage
The system provides an interactive function `predict_sms_spam()` that can classify any SMS message as spam or legitimate with confidence scores.
